# Author: Langston Hughes

What happens to a dream deferred?

Does it dry up
like a raisin in the sun?
Or fester like a sore-

like a syrupy sweet?

Maybe it just sags
like a heavy load.

Or does it explode?

# Author: Wiliam Carlos Williams

glazed with rain
water
beside the white
chickens

Tyger, tyger, burning bright,
in the forests of the night;

What immortal hand or eye,
Could frame thy fearful symmetry?

# Title: "Row, Row, Row Your Boat (Kingly version)"
# Author: Fred Rogers

Propel, propel, propel your craft,
Gently through liquid solution.

Ecstatically, ecstatically, ecstatically, ecstatically, 
Existence is but an illusion.

The west wind whispered,
And touched the eyelids of spring:
Her eyes, Primroses.

An old silent pond…
A frog jumps into the pond,
splash! Silence again.
