# Title: "Harlem"
# Author: Langston Hughes

What happens to a dream deferred?

Does it dry up
like a raisin in the sun?
Or fester like a sore-

Or crust and sugar over-
like a syrupy sweet?

Maybe it just sags
like a heavy load.

Or does it explode?

# Title: excerpt from "Ozymandias"
# Author: Percy Bysshe Shelley

And on the pedestal these words appear:
“My name is Ozymandias, King of Kings.

I lift my lamp beside the golden door!”

They were delicious
so sweet
and so cold

barrow

glazed with rain
water
beside the white
chickens

Tyger, tyger, burning bright,
in the forests of the night;
What immortal hand or eye,
Could frame thy fearful symmetry?

# Title: "Row, Row, Row Your Boat (Kingly version)"

Propel, propel, propel your craft,
Gently through liquid solution.

Ecstatically, ecstatically, ecstatically, ecstatically, 
Existence is but an illusion.

The west wind whispered,
And touched the eyelids of spring:
Her eyes, Primroses.

An old silent pond…
A frog jumps into the pond,
splash! Silence again.
