Windows and Linux are built on Linux.  mingw-w64 is used for the Windows builds on Linux.
It's a lot easier to use Ubuntu with mingw to build the Windows builds than on Windows itself,
especially when it's really easy to install Ubuntu on Windows.

Windows x86-64:
	make compiler=x86_64-w64-mingw32-g++ platform=windows build=release link="-s -static -lws2_32 -lole32" -f GNUmakefile
Windows i386:
	make compiler=i686-w64-mingw32-g++ platform=windows build=release link="-s -static -lws2_32 -lole32" -f GNUmakefile
Linux x86-64:
	make compiler=g++ build=release -f GNUmakefile
